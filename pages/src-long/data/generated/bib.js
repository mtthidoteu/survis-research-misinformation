        "abstract": "Journalism has always remained a vital constituent of our society and journalists play a key role in making people aware of the happenings and developments in society. This spread of information enables shaping the ideologies, orientations and thoughts of individuals as well as the society. Contrary to this, the spread of misinformation or fake news leads to detrimental consequences. With the advent of social media, the menace of fake news has become grievous due to the unrestrained propagation of information and difficulty to track several accounts operated by humans or bots. This menace can be mitigated through data science approaches by combining artificial intelligence with statistics and domain-based knowledge. In this paper, a survey of works aimed at characterization, feature extraction and subsequent detection of fake news has been conducted from a data science perspective. Along with it, an analysis of the 8 renowned fake news detection repositories has been presented. Furthermore, through a case study on tweets related to COVID-19 pandemic, the factors behind the spread of misinformation during critical times, distinguishing between factual and emotional tweets and viable approaches to restrain fake news has been enunciated.",

This shift in public behavior has opened doors for some to diffuse fake news on social media; and subsequently cause negative economic, political, and social consequences as well as distrust among the public. There are many proposed methods to solve the rumor detection problem, most of which do not take full advantage of the heterogeneous nature of news propagation networks. With this intention, we considered a previously proposed architecture as our baseline and performed the idea of structural feature extraction from the heterogeneous rumor propagation over its architecture using the concept of meta path-based embeddings. We named our model Meta Path-based Global Local Attention Network (MGLAN). Extensive experimental analysis on three state-of-the-art datasets has demonstrated that MGLAN outperforms other models by capturing node-level discrimination to different node types.",

        "abstract": "According to recent research, geometric deep learning allows to reach unprecedented accuracy for online misinformation detection. By fully leveraging the news social context, URL propagation paths in social networks are first represented as graphs and then classified using Graph Neural Network (GNN) models. Despite these remarkable efforts, researchers are still hampered by the scarcity of high-quality benchmark datasets, and as a result, the efficacy of state-of-the-art approaches could be overestimated. So far, in order to obtain a decent number of third-party fact-checked URLs, researchers have either sampled news from notoriously reliable and unreliable sources using distant supervision, or they have gathered pre-labeled URLs from third-party fact-checking websites. In the former case, resulting datasets can be quite large, but also noisy and biased since pieces of news are labeled as true or false according to their source label, and not individually fact-checked. In the latter case, assigned labels are more reliable, but the included news articles are usually in a single language and they may reflect unknown editorial decisions. As a result, datasets of the latter type are typically small, homogeneous, and thus unrealistically easy for automatic fake news detection models. In this work, we present FbMultiLingMisinfo, a new multilingual benchmark dataset, aimed at a more realistic evaluation of state-of-the-art misinformation detection models. URLs in our dataset come from the Facebook Privacy-Protected Full URLs Data Set, which we augmented with their propagation paths on Twitter. Our experimental results show that, when GNN-based models are tested on FbMultiLingMisinfo, recent misinformation detection results are only partially confirmed. We further show that a sharp reduction in the training size significantly reduces the model accuracy on FbMultiLingMisinfo, but not on two other widely used benchmark datasets for fake news detection.",

Therefore, detecting Chinese fake news is a challenging and meaningful task. However, existing fake news datasets from Chinese social media platforms have a relatively small amount of data and data collection in this field is relatively old, thus being unable to meet the requirements of further research. In consideration of this background, we release a new Chinese Weibo Fake News dataset, which contains 26320 fake news data collected from Weibo. In addition, we propose a fake news detection model based on data augmentation that can effectively solve the problem of a lack of fake news, and we improve the generalization ability and robustness of the model. We conduct numerous experiments on our Chinese Weibo Fake News dataset and successfully deploy the model on the web page.

        "abstract": "In recent years, social platforms have become the main venue for disseminating fake news. Since much fake news is deliberately fabricated by malicious users or generated by adversarial deep learning models, content-only approaches can not detect fake news effectively. Compared to texts, the propagation patterns of fake news are much harder to be forged. Recent work found that the \u201ccontext\u201d of news, the tree-structured graph representing the propagation relationship of news and Twitter posts, is vital for fake news detection. Some work utilize graph neural networks to learn the representation of news' context graphs, achieving stunning performance. However, these methods still suffer from two problems. Firstly, Twitters posts in the context of news are not equally important for fake news detection. However, most previous works treat them equally. Moreover, the context of news presents diverse structures such as \u201cstar-shaped\u201d graphs, with many nodes interacting with a central node, or \u201cline-shaped\u201d graphs, with sparse connections among neighbors. With single-scale graph representation, previous work can not handle diverse structures well. We propose a novel diversity-aware context attention network to cope with these problems. A context attention pooling function is proposed to extract the critical information within the context. It utilizes an attention module to automatically assign a greater weight to those important posts and a smaller weight to helpless posts. Furthermore, jump knowledge, which concatenates the pooling result from multiple network layers, is adopted. It offers the model multi-scale receptive fields and better adapts to diverse structures. Extensive experiments are conducted under various dataset settings, which confirms the superiority of our approaches over state-of-the-art models.",

        "abstract": "Social media has become an ideal platform for the propagation of rumors, fake news, and misinformation. Rumors on social media not only mislead online users but also affect the real world immensely. Thus, detecting the rumors and preventing their spread became an essential task. Some of the recent deep learning-based rumor detection methods, such as Bi-Directional Graph Convolutional Networks (Bi-GCN), represent rumor using the completed stage of the rumor diffusion and try to learn the structural information from it. However, these methods are limited to represent rumor propagation as a static graph, which isn\u2019t optimal for capturing the dynamic information of the rumors. In this study, we propose novel graph convolutional networks with attention mechanisms, named Dynamic GCN, for rumor detection. We first represent rumor posts with their responsive posts as dynamic graphs. The temporal information is used to generate a sequence of graph snapshots. The representation learning on graph snapshots with attention mechanism captures both structural and temporal information of rumor spreads. The conducted experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of Dynamic GCN over the state-of-the-art methods in the rumor detection task.",

We propose to construct heterogeneous social context graphs around news articles and reformulate the problem as a graph classification task.

The majority of existing fake news detection algorithms focus on mining news content and/or the surrounding exogenous context for discovering deceptive signals; while the endogenous preference of a user when he/she decides to spread a piece of fake news or not is ignored. The confirmation bias theory has indicated that a user is more likely to spread a piece of fake news when it confirms his/her existing beliefs/preferences. Users' historical, social engagements such as posts provide rich information about users' preferences toward news and have great potentials to advance fake news detection. However, the work on exploring user preference for fake news detection is somewhat limited. Therefore, in this paper, we study the novel problem of exploiting user preference for fake news detection. We propose a new framework, UPFD, which simultaneously captures various signals from user preferences by joint content and graph modeling. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

To compete for users\u2019 attention, short video platforms have been overusing algorithmic technology, making the group polarization intensify, which is likely to push users into the homogeneous \u201cecho chamber\u201d. However, echo chambers can contribute to the spread of misleading information, false news, or rumors, which have negative social impacts. Therefore, it is necessary to explore echo chamber effects in short video platforms. Moreover, the communication paradigms between users and feed algorithms greatly vary across short video platforms. This paper investigated echo chamber effects of three popular short video platforms (Douyin, TikTok, and Bilibili) using social network analysis and explored how user features influenced the generation of echo chambers. We quantified echo chamber effects through two primary ingredients: selective exposure and homophily, in both platform and topic dimensions. Our analyses indicate that the gathering of users into homogeneous groups dominates online interactions on Douyin and Bilibili. We performed performance comparison of echo chamber effects and found that echo chamber members tend to display themselves to attract the attention of their peers and that cultural differences can prevent the development of echo chambers. Our findings are of great value in designing targeted management strategies to prevent the spread of misleading information, false news, or rumors.",

        "abstract": "The daily exposure of social media users to propaganda and disinformation campaigns has reinvigorated the need to investigate the local and global patterns of diffusion of different (mis)information content on social media. Echo chambers and influencers are often deemed responsible of both the polarization of users in online social networks and the success of propaganda and disinformation campaigns. This article adopts a data-driven approach to investigate the structuration of communities and propaganda networks on Twitter in order to assess the correctness of these imputations. In particular, the work aims at characterizing networks of propaganda extracted from a Twitter dataset by combining the information gained by three different classification approaches, focused respectively on (i) using Tweets content to infer the \u201cpolarization\u201d of users around a specific topic, (ii) identifying users having an active role in the diffusion of different propaganda and disinformation items, and (iii) analyzing social ties to identify topological clusters and users playing a \u201ccentral\u201d role in the network. The work identifies highly partisan community structures along political alignments; furthermore, centrality metrics proved to be very informative to detect the most active users in the network and to distinguish users playing different roles; finally, polarization and clustering structure of the retweet graphs provided useful insights about relevant properties of users exposure, interactions, and participation to different propaganda items.",

        "abstract": "Although significant effort has been applied to fact-checking, the prevalence of fake news over social media, which has profound impact on justice, public trust and our society, remains a serious problem. In this work, we focus on propagation-based fake news detection, as recent studies have demonstrated that fake news and real news spread differently online. Specifically, considering the capability of graph neural networks (GNNs) in dealing with non-Euclidean data, we use GNNs to differentiate between the propagation patterns of fake and real news on social media. In particular, we concentrate on two questions: (1) Without relying on any text information, e.g., tweet content, replies and user descriptions, how accurately can GNNs identify fake news? Machine learning models are known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and avoiding the dependence on text-based features can make the model less susceptible to the manipulation of advanced fake news fabricators. (2) How to deal with new, unseen data? In other words, how does a GNN trained on a given dataset perform on a new and potentially vastly different dataset? If it achieves unsatisfactory performance, how do we solve the problem without re-training the model on the entire data from scratch? We study the above questions on two datasets with thousands of labelled news items, and our results show that: (1) GNNs can achieve comparable or superior performance without any text information to state-of-the-art methods. (2) GNNs trained on a given dataset may perform poorly on new, unseen data, and direct incremental training cannot solve the problem\u2014this issue has not been addressed in the previous work that applies GNNs for fake news detection. In order to solve the problem, we propose a method that achieves balanced performance on both existing and new datasets, by using techniques from continual learning to train GNNs incrementally.",

        "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed the significant damage caused by various types of fake news. Although considerable effort has been applied to address this issue and much progress has been made on detecting fake news, most existing approaches mainly rely on the textual content and/or social context, while knowledge-level information\u2014entities extracted from the news content and the relations between them\u2014is much less explored. Within the limited work on knowledge-based fake news detection, an external knowledge graph is often required, which may introduce additional problems: it is quite common for entities and relations, especially with respect to new concepts, to be missing in existing knowledge graphs, and both entity prediction and link prediction are open research questions themselves. Therefore, in this work, we investigate \\textbf{knowledge-based fake news detection that does not require any external knowledge graph.} Specifically, our contributions include: (1) transforming the problem of detecting fake news into a subgraph classification task\u2014entities and relations are extracted from each news item to form a single knowledge graph, where a news item is represented by a subgraph. Then a graph neural network (GNN) model is trained to classify each subgraph/news item. (2) Further improving the performance of this model through a simple but effective multi-modal technique that combines extracted knowledge, textual content and social context. Experiments on multiple datasets with thousands of labelled news items demonstrate that our knowledge-based algorithm outperforms existing counterpart methods, and its performance can be further boosted by the multi-modal approach.",

News usually involves texts and images to be more vivid. Consequently, multi-modal fake news detection has received wide attention. Prior efforts primarily conduct multi-modal fusion by simple concatenation or co-attention mechanism, leading to sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a novel mutual learning network based model MMNet, which enhances the multi-modal fusion for fake news detection via mutual learning between text-and vision-centered views towards the same classification objective. Specifically, we design two detection modules respectively based on text-and vision-centered multi-modal fusion features, and enable the mutual learning of the two modules to facilitate the multi-modal fusion, considering the latent consistency between the two modules towards the same training objective. Moreover, we also consider the influence of the image-text matching degree on news authenticity judgement by designing an image-text matching aware co-attention mechanism for multi-modal fusion. Extensive experiments are conducted on three benchmark datasets and the results demonstrate that our proposed MMNet achieves superior performance in fake news detection.",

        "abstract": "We investigate works under the propagation-based fake news detection domain, which recently seeks to improve performance through the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Generally, existing works argue that using GNNs can give results superior to what was obtained using classic graph-based methods. We agree with this argument given that GNNs are capable of gaining superior performance by leveraging node features. But we argue that existing works haven\u2019t identified the fact that the expressivity of GNNs is limited and bounded by node features. Existing works do not acknowledge that, by utilizing GNNs, they implicitly assume node features are strongly correlated to node labels. There are evidence that node features that have been employed do not necessarily correlate to node label. Instead of having a profound theoretical motivation, they have empirically observed that focusing on nodes features with strong feature-label correlation can increase predictive capability. This is a sub-optimal approach to view this problem, in fact, we argue that finding node features based on correlation is not practical or effective. Our first contribution is shifting readers from a node-level view i.e correlating node features with labels, to a graph-level view. In the graph-level view, we exploit the relationship between graph isomorphism and GNNs\u2019 expressivity which can be utilized to well understand and interpret the relation between node features and GNNs\u2019 expressivity. We conduct a wide range of experiments on basis of both node-level view and graph-level view and found graph-level view is more interpretable and strongly matches with results. Further, we gained insights on node features that wouldn\u2019t be obtainable by a node-level view. In order to have a fair and comprehensive analysis of node features, we built a unified dataset that includes a wide range of node features. Our results indicate, as we improve model accuracy on basis of the graph level view, models\u2019 generalizability decreases. We provide our hypothesis for this performance trade-off on the basis of the graph-level view. Our results and insights call for a much broader discussion on whether any sort of filtering method is effective. So, we conclude our work by providing readers with possible solutions that can be helpful to find harmony between node features and GNNs\u2019 expressivity.",

        "abstract": "Recently, the use of social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, and Sina Weibo has become an inseparable part of our daily lives. It is considered as a convenient platform for users to share personal messages, pictures, and videos. However, while people enjoy social networks, many deceptive activities such as fake news or rumors can mislead users into believing misinformation. Besides, spreading the massive amount of misinformation in social networks has become a global risk. Therefore, misinformation detection (MID) in social networks has gained a great deal of attention and is considered an emerging area of research interest. We find that several studies related to MID have been studied to new research problems and techniques. While important, however, the automated detection of misinformation is difficult to accomplish as it requires the advanced model to understand how related or unrelated the reported information is when compared to real information. The existing studies have mainly focused on three broad categories of misinformation: false information, fake news, and rumor detection. Therefore, related to the previous issues, we present a comprehensive survey of automated misinformation detection on (i) false information, (ii) rumors, (iii) spam, (iv) fake news, and (v) disinformation. We provide a state-of-the-art review on MID where deep learning (DL) is used to automatically process data and create patterns to make decisions not only to extract global features but also to achieve better results. We further show that DL is an effective and scalable technique for the state-of-the-art MID. Finally, we suggest several open issues that currently limit real-world implementation and point to future directions along this dimension.",

        "abstract": "Nowadays, fake news easily propagates through online social networks and becomes a grand threat to individuals and society. Assessing the authenticity of news is challenging due to its elaborately fabricated contents, making it difficult to obtain large-scale annotations for fake news data. Due to such data scarcity issues, detecting fake news tends to fail and overfit in the supervised setting. Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been adopted to leverage the richer relational information among both labeled and unlabeled instances. Despite their promising results, they are inherently focused on pairwise relations between news, which can limit the expressive power for capturing fake news that spreads in a group-level. For example, detecting fake news can be more effective when we better understand relations between news pieces shared among susceptible users. To address those issues, we propose to leverage a hypergraph to represent group-wise interaction among news, while focusing on important news relations with its dual-level attention mechanism. Experiments based on two benchmark datasets show that our approach yields remarkable performance and maintains the high performance even with a small subset of labeled news data.",

Since fake news is disinformation with malicious intent, manual fact-checking requires great effort. In order to cope with these challenges, many automatic fake news detection models have been introduced. Recent studies have shown that social network information along with news content can be used effectively for detecting fake news. In this paper, we propose a Topological and Sequential Neural Network model (TSNN) for detecting fake news by capturing the diffusion patterns between source news and users in social networks. We employ the supernode approach instead of simple graph pooling methods to extract representative features in graph topological structure. To better learn the representations in the supernode, we design two-staged graph neural networks reflecting the heterogeneity between news and Twitter users. Our model additionally captures sequential information on news diffusion path by using a transformer. We evaluate our model with two fake news benchmark datasets annotated by fact-checking websites: PolitiFact and GossipCop. TSNN achieves 92.15\\% accuracy and 92.11\\% F1-score on PolitiFact, and 97.91\\% accuracy and 97.88\\% F1-score on GossipCop. These results demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms other baselines, establishing it as a state-of-the-art solution for fake news detection. To verify the effectiveness following model configuration, we perform ablation studies to demonstrate how each component among our two-stage graph neural networks, and sequential information modules contribute to the performance improvements.",

        "abstract": "Detection of fake news is crucial to ensure the authenticity of information and maintain the news ecosystem's reliability. Recently, there has been an increase in fake news content due to the recent proliferation of social media and fake content generation techniques such as Deep-Fake. The majority of the existing modalities of fake news detection focus on content-based approaches. However, most of these techniques fail to deal with ultra-realistic synthesized media produced by generative models. Our recent studies find that the propagation characteristics of authentic and fake news are distinguishable, irrespective of their modalities. In this regard, we have investigated the auxiliary information based on social context to detect fake news. This paper has analyzed the social context of fake news detection with a hybrid graph neural network-based approach. This hybrid model is based on integrating a graph neural network on the propagation of news and bi-directional encoder representations from the transformers model on news content to learn the text features. Thus this proposed approach learns the content as well as the context features and hence able to outperform the baseline models with an f1-score of 0.91 on Politifact and 0.93 on the Gossipcop dataset, respectively",

Based on the dual-layer graph, we propose a fake news detection model Us-DeFake. It learns the propagation features of news in the news layer and the interaction features of users in the user layer. Through the inter-layer in the graph, Us-DeFake fuses the user signals that contain credibility information into the news features, to provide distinctive user-aware embeddings of news for fake news detection. The training process conducts on multiple dual-layer subgraphs obtained by a graph sampler to scale Us-DeFake in large scale social networks. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets illustrate the superiority of Us-DeFake which outperforms all baselines, and the users' credibility signals learned by interaction relation can notably improve the performance of our model.",

This paper uses a network simulation model to study a possible relationship between echo chambers and the viral spread of misinformation. It finds an \u201cecho chamber effect\u201d: the presence of an opinion and network polarized cluster of nodes in a network contributes to the diffusion of complex contagions, and there is a synergetic effect between opinion and network polarization on the virality of misinformation.

Some previous methods have focused on modeling the news content, while others have combined user comments and user information on social media. However, existing methods ignore some important clues for detecting fake news, such as temporal information on social media and external knowledge related to the news. To this end, we propose a Knowledge-Aware Hierarchical Attention Network (KAHAN) that integrates this information into the model to establish fact-based associations with entities in the news content. Specifically, we introduce two hierarchical attention networks to model news content and user comments respectively, in which news content and user comments are represented by different aspects for modeling various degrees of semantic granularity. Besides, to process the random occurrences of user comments at post-level, we further designed a time-based subevent division algorithm to aggregate user comments at subevent-level to learn temporal patterns. Moreover, News towards Entities (N-E) attention and Comments towards Entities (C-E) attention are introduced to measure the importance of external knowledge. Finally, we detected the veracity of the news by combining the three aspects of news: content, user comments, and external knowledge. We conducted extensive experiments and ablation studies on two real-world datasets and showed that our proposed method outperformed the previous methods and empirically validated each component of KAHAN1.",

With the increasing popularity of news consumption on various social media platforms, there has been a surge of misinformation which includes false information or unfounded claims. As various text- and social context-based fake news detectors are proposed to detect misinformation on social media, recent works start to focus on the vulnerabilities of fake news detectors. In this paper, we present the first adversarial attack framework against Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based fake news detectors to probe their robustness. Specifically, we leverage a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework to simulate the adversarial behavior of fraudsters on social media. Research has shown that in real-world settings, fraudsters coordinate with each other to share different news in order to evade the detection of fake news detectors. Therefore, we modeled our MARL framework as a Markov Game with bot, cyborg, and crowd worker agents, which have their own distinctive cost, budget, and influence. We then use deep Q-learning to search for the optimal policy that maximizes the rewards. Extensive experimental results on two real-world fake news propagation datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework can effectively sabotage the GNN-based fake news detector performance. We hope this paper can provide insights for future research on fake news detection.",

In this paper, we propose a novel dual graph-based model, Uncertainty-aware Propagation Structure Reconstruction (UPSR) for improving fake news detection. Specifically, after the original propagation modeling, we introduce propagation structure reconstruction to fully explore latent interactions in the actual propagation.

However, edge noise remains a critical challenge in real-world graphs, as training on suboptimal structures can severely limit the expressiveness of GNNs. Despite initial efforts in graph structure learning (GSL), prior works often leverage node features to update edge weights, resulting in heavy computational costs that hinder the methods' applicability to large-scale social graphs. In this work, we approach the fake news detection problem with a novel aspect of social graph refinement. We find that the degrees of news article nodes exhibit distinctive patterns, which are indicative of news veracity. Guided by this, we propose DECOR, a novel application of Degree-Corrected Stochastic Blockmodels to the fake news detection problem. Specifically, we encapsulate our empirical observations into a lightweight social graph refinement component that iteratively updates the edge weights via a learnable degree correction mask, which allows for joint optimization with a GNN-based detector.

Despite being widely used, we find that these datasets suffer from spurious correlations, which are ignored by existing studies and lead to severe overestimation of existing rumor detection performance. The spurious correlations stem from three causes: (1) event-based data collection and labeling schemes assign the same veracity label to multiple highly similar posts from the same underlying event; (2) merging multiple data sources spuriously relates source identities to veracity labels; and (3) labeling bias. In this paper, we closely investigate three of the most popular rumor detection benchmark datasets (i.e., Twitter15, Twitter16 and PHEME), and propose event-separated rumor detection as a solution to eliminate spurious cues. Under the event-separated setting, we observe that the accuracy of existing state-of-the-art models drops significantly by over 40\\%, becoming only comparable to a simple neural classifier. To better address this task, we propose Publisher Style Aggregation (PSA), a generalizable approach that aggregates publisher posting records to learn writing style and veracity stance.

        "abstract": "Fake news and misinformation spread rapidly on the Internet. How to identify it and how to interpret the identification results have become important issues. In this paper, we propose a Dual Co-Attention Network (Dual-CAN) for fake news detection, which takes news content, social media replies, and external knowledge into consideration. Our experimental results support that the proposed Dual-CAN outperforms current representative models in two benchmark datasets. We further make in-depth discussions by comparing how models work in both datasets with empirical analysis of attention weights.",

        "abstract": "The wide spread of fake news has caused serious societal issues. We propose a subgraph reasoning paradigm for fake news detection, which provides a crystal type of explainability by revealing which subgraphs of the news propagation network are the most important for news verification, and concurrently improves the generalization and discrimination power of graph-based detection models by removing task-irrelevant information. In particular, we propose a reinforced subgraph generation method, and perform fine-grained modeling on the generated subgraphs by developing a Hierarchical Path-aware Kernel Graph Attention Network. We also design a curriculum-based optimization method to ensure better convergence and train the two parts in an end-to-end manner.",

        "abstract": "Recently rumors have been rapidly propagated while the Internet has been extensively developed. Research shows that highly credible comments with a distinct stance have worthy information. In this paper, we attempt to combine user credibility and user stance to capture worthy comments during the information-dissemination process to detect rumors. We propose a User Stance Bi-Directional Graph Attention Networks (USBGAT) model to extract accurate information for rumor detection based on high credibility users with strong stance, and diminish ineffectively neutral comments. Specifically, we take user features and user stance as a component of the node features, with multiviews features of tweets content engaged. Then, we use bidirectional graph attention networks (GAT) to capture the high-level representation of the rumor. Furthermore, we reweight the node features according to users' stances. Extensive experiments on two datasets: Pheme and Weibo show that our model is superior to the state-of-the-art models, especially in the early rumor detection.
